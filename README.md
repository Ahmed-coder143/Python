**Adding_two_numbers.py:**
above one is basic addition program, I gave input(two numbers)through program and addition the numbers.

**Addition_get_input_from_user_basic.py:**
this program basic additon progaram,we will get input(two numbers) from user and add the numbers and then show result

**Odd-Even Number Checker Program.py":**
I have implemented a program that takes user input, checks the conditions using an 'if' statement, and prints whether the given value is odd, even, or zero

**Simple-Square-Program.py:**
This Python program takes user input, stores the value in a variable named 'number,' squares the 'number,' stores the result in a variable named 'square,' and prints the final squared value.

**Modulo-Operation-Praogram:**
This simple Python program demonstrates the use of the modulo operation (%). for example if user inputs it sets 'number1' to 10, 'number2' to 3, and then prints the result of 'a % b,' showcasing the remainder when 'number1' is divided by 'number2'

**Reverse_string.py:**
This Python code takes a string as user input, converts it to a new string, and then prints the reversed version of the input string. The reversal is achieved using slicing with [::-1].

**Counting_number.py:**
This Python code takes an integer input (input_number) from the user and uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to the inputted value (inclusive). Each number is printed on a new line, providing a simple counting sequence.

**If-else-program.py**
This Python code determines and prints the maximum of three numbers (number1,number2,number3) entered by the user. The program uses conditional statements to compare the values and identify the largest number among them.

**Separate-digits-to-integer.py**
The user to enter a number. It then converts the input integer into a list of its individual digits using a list comprehension. The script concludes by displaying the separated digits using the print function, providing a simple example of digit extraction in Python.


**Minimum-Number.py**
The user to input a list of numbers separated by spaces. It then converts the input into a list of integers and utilizes the built-in min function to identify and print the smallest number from the provided list. 

**Maximum-Number.py**
The user to input a list of numbers separated by spaces. It then converts the input into a list of integers and utilizes the built-in min function to identify and print the largest number from the provided list. 

**Sum-of-digits.py**
This Python program takes a user-input integer and calculates the sum of its individual digits using a while loop. It iteratively extracts the last digit of the number and adds it to a running sum until there are no more digits left. Finally, it prints the calculated sum.

**Calculate-sum-using-range.py**
This Python program prompts the user to enter an integer, and then calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to the entered number (inclusive). It utilizes a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers and accumulates the sum in the variable sum_num. Finally, it prints the total sum.

**Length-count.py**
The user to enter a numerical input. It then calculates and displays the length of the input using the len function. This concise Python program offers a quick way to determine the number of characters in the user's input, providing insight into the length of the entered value.

**Calculate-length-of-string.py**
This Python program takes a user-input string, removes any spaces from it, and then calculates and prints the length of the modified string. It uses the replace method to eliminate spaces, and the len function is applied to determine the length of the resulting string. The program prompts the user to enter a string, processes it, and displays the length of the string without spaces.

**Extract-digits.py**
This Python program prompts the user to enter a number, then converts each digit of the number into a list of integers using a list comprehension. The resulting list is printed as individual values. 

**Simple-interest.py**
This Python program takes user input for principal amount (P), time duration (T), and rate of interest (R). It then calculates the Simple Interest (SI) using the formula SI = (P * T * R) / 100 and prints the result. The input is obtained as space-separated values and assigned to the respective variables using the map function.
