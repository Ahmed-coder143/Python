It then calculates the Simple Interest (SI) using the formula SI = (P * T * R) / 100 and prints the result. The input is obtained as space-separated values and assigned to the respective variables using the map function.

**Capitalize.py**
This Python program prompts the user to input a string, then reverses the string and capitalizes the first letter. It utilizes string slicing with [::-1] to reverse the string and the capitalize() method to capitalize the first letter. The result is then printed.

**ODD-Even-Separator.py**
This Python code prompts the user to input a number, converts it into a list of its individual digits, and then separates the even and odd digits into two distinct lists ('i' for even and 'j' for odd). Finally, the script prints the results, displaying the even and odd digits separately with appropriate labels.

**Reverse-word.py**
This Python code takes a user input string, reverses the order of its individual words, and then prints the reversed string. The reversed string is constructed by joining the reversed words using whitespace as a separator

**Bitwise-NOT-Operation.py**
This Python script takes a user-input integer, computes its bitwise complement using the unary bitwise NOT operator (~), and prints the result. The bitwise complement operation inverts each bit of the binary representation of the given number.

**Rock-Paper-Scissors Game.py**
This Python script implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where two players input their choices (rock, paper, or scissors), and the program determines the winner based on the game rules. The variables P, R, and S represent the choices for rock, paper, and scissors, respectively. The script checks for different combinations of player inputs and prints the result, whether it's a draw ("D") or one of the players wins (either "P" for paper wins, "R" for rock wins, or "S" for scissors wins).

**func-sample.py**
The "func" function takes two numerical parameters, x and y, and performs basic arithmetic operations on them. The function prints the sum, difference, quotient, product, and remainder of x and y. Additionally, it prints a summary line containing all these results. In the provided example with values 4 and 8, the function demonstrates these operations for those specific inputs.

**Lambda.py**
This Python code defines a lambda function named "func" that takes a variable number of arguments (*x) and calculates their sum using the built-in sum() function. The lambda function is then invoked with the arguments 10, 2, 4, 2, and 3. The result is stored in the variable "result" and printed, which, in this case, outputs the sum of the provided numbers (10 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 3).

**Func-avg-sum.py**
This Python code defines a function named "func" that takes four parameters representing numerical values (m1, m2, m3, m4). Inside the function, it calculates the average and sum of these values. The average is computed by dividing the sum of the values by 10. The function then returns a tuple containing the average and sum.

The function is invoked with specific values (8, 6, 9, 7), and the result is stored in the variable "result." Finally, the tuple is printed, displaying both the average and the sum of the provided numbers.

**Common-Elements-Checker.py**
This Python script takes two lists of numbers as input, converts them to sets, prints the original lists, prints the common elements if any, and determines if there are any common elements between the two sets. It then prints "Common elements: yes" if there are common elements and "Common elements: no" otherwise

**ASCII-Sum.py**
This Python script defines a function, sum_ascii, which calculates the sum of ASCII values for each character in a given string. The user is prompted to input a string, and the script then prints the total ASCII sum.

**Divisibility-Checker-for-7.py**

**Even-and-Odd-Digit-Sorter.py**
This Python script takes a numeric input, separates its digits into even and odd groups, and prints the sorted lists of even and odd digits.

**Multiples.py**
This Python script takes a user-input integer, generates multiples of 9 up to that number, and prints the list of the generated values.

**Number-Positivity-Checker.py**
This Python script defines a function func that takes a numeric input, checks if it's positive, negative, or zero, and then prints the result.

**Positivity-Lambda.py**
This Python script uses a lambda function to check if a user-input number is positive, negative, or zero and prints the result.

**Counting-binary.py**
This Python script takes an integer as user input, converts it to its binary representation using the bin() function, counts the number of '1's in the binary string using the count() method, and prints the result. The output provides the count of set bits (ones) in the binary representation of the entered number. This script serves as a simple tool to determine the number of '1's in the binary form of a given integer.

**Hexadecimal.py**
This Python script prompts the user to input a binary number, converts it to its decimal equivalent using the int() function with base 2, and then further converts the decimal number to its hexadecimal representation using the hex() function. The script finally prints the original binary number along with its hexadecimal equivalent. This tool provides a simple conversion from binary to hexadecimal in Python.
